# ResposniveCalculator
The repository code for a Responsive Normal Calculator.

I have succefully made used of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

1. HTML is used to make basic HTML structure of the calculator. Appropriate tags are used 
to define different sections, such as the display area, button, and other elements.

2. I have applied CSS Styling to make the calculator visually appealing.Designing the layout,
color, and typography is done to make it user-friendly and good-looking. Various CSS classes and
IDs are used to target specific elements for styling.

3. Javascript Functionalities Used for :-
   3.1. Applying Basic Arithmetic Operations.
        Functions for basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, substraction, multiplication,
   and division are implemented. These functions takes two or more input values, performing the
   corresponding operations, and displaying the result on the calculator's display area.

  3.2. Applying Clear and Delete Functionality.
       These finctionalities allows to clear the display area and delete individual digits.

  3.3. Error Handling.
       Error Handling is to handle scenarios such as dividing by zero.
